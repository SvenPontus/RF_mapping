"""
A class for analyzing DeepLabCut (DLC) project files and extracting
relevant information, such as mean likelihood from labeled data and model loss metrics.

Methods
-------
save_mean_likelihood_to_file(project_path)
    Saves the mean likelihood for all likelihood values in each
    .h5 file within the specified project path to a text file.
    
plot_loss_to_png(project_path)
    Plots the training and validation losses from the 'learning_stats.csv' file and saves
    the plot as a PNG image.

get_config_and_video_paths(project_path)
    Returns the path to the config.yaml file and a list of video
    file paths in the project.
