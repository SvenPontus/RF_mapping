To prevent training from stopping when you log out, 
assuming all files are located under /local/..., 
follow these steps:

Create a script file with the command to start the training, 
call it train.sh. The file should look something like this:
#!/bin/bash
python main.py

Next, create another script file called train_nohup.sh, 
with the following content:
#!/bin/bash
nohup ./train.sh > output.txt < /dev/null &

Here, nohup (short for no hang up) ensures that the process 
continues running even after you disconnect from the session.

To make these files executable, you may need to change the permissions:
chmod +x train.sh
chmod +x train_nohup.sh

Start the training by running:
./train_nohup.sh

If you need to stop the training early, 
run top to find the process ID, and then in the terminal, type:
kill -9 process_id

Where process_id is the number of the process you want to terminate.
